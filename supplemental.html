<h3>Data, Sample, Variables</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) as prepared for and described in Pfeffer and Killewald (2018). A replication package containing the data and code used in that paper is available through the PSID Public Data Extract Repository via OpenICPSR at <a href="http://doi.org/10.3886/E101094V1">http://doi.org/10.3886/E101094V1</a> and a full replication package for the animations reported here is available at <a href="http://github.com/fpfeffer/wealthmobility">http://github.com/fpfeffer/wealthmobility</a>.</p>
<p>The net worth measure in the PSID is based on a set of survey questions on the ownership and value of separate assets components, including financial assets (e.g. savings, stocks, etc.), real estate (home value minus mortgages), other real assets (e.g. business and farm wealth, real estate, etc.), and different forms of debt. Parental wealth is measured as average household net worth in survey years 1984 and 1989, which contain the first full asset survey modules. Offspring’s wealth is measured as average household net worth in survey years 2013 and 2015. We restrict the analytic sample to offspring aged 45-64 (N=1,936) to reduce life-cycle bias in estimates of intergenerational wealth mobility (as revealed in Pfeffer and Killewald 2018). The average parental age in this sample is 52.0 years (in 1984) and the average offspring age is 53.6 years (in 2013). Net worth quintiles are drawn based on the analytic sample just described and using the weighted distribution of wealth for parents and children. The racial classification relies on the first mention of the offspring’s race and distinguishes Non-Hispanic whites from Non-Hispanic Blacks.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> The sample size is too low to support separate analyses of other racial or ethnic groups.</p>

<h3>Additional Information on Animation 1</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Unlike the visualization in Badger et al. (2018), which relied on full population administrative data (Chetty et al. 2018), our visualization draws on a much smaller sample from survey data. Thus, rather than simply displaying transition rates based on observed cases, we need to estimate transition probabilities more parsimoniously in a statistical model.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> Animation 1 displays predicted probabilities from an ordered logistic regression model, that is,</p>
<p>$$ {Pr(y=q|x)=F(\tau_q-\mathbf{x}\beta) - F(\tau_{q-1}-\mathbf{x}\beta)} $$</p>
<p>which describes the probability of a child attaining the \(q\)’th wealth quintile, \(y\), dependent on a vector \(\bf x\) containing dummy indicators of parental wealth quintile. \(F\) is the logistic cumulative distribution function and the \(\tau_q\) parameters describe the cut-points of the latent measurement model. We estimate the ordered logistic regression separately for white and Black children, which not only accommodates different transition rates, \(\beta\), across race (which could also be attained in a jointly estimated model by interacting the indicators of parental wealth quintiles with indicators of race) but also allows the cut-points of the measurement model to vary by race. The regressions are estimated using PSID’s longitudinal individual weights, which partly adjust for attrition (Berglund et al. 2017a; more on weighting below).</p>
<p>One of the parametric assumptions of the ordered logistic models is the proportional odds assumption, which constrains all \(\beta\)s to be equal across outcome categories \(q\). Using global significance tests (see Long and Freese 2014: 329) provides no evidence that this assumption is violated,<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> lending credibility to the modeling approach chosen for the main animation.</p>
<p>Still, other analysts may be interested in the impact of alternative modeling approaches with either more or less stringent constraints. Animation S.1 displays the results created under alternative approaches: First, a slightly more parsimonious model estimates the ordered logistic regression model jointly for both races with interactions between parental wealth quintiles and race. This joint model produces a common set of cut-off estimates, in essence, additionally imposing the proportional odds assumption on the race main effect and the race by parental wealth interactions. As a consequence, the statistical support for this more stringent set of assumptions is less unequivocal than before.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> Second, we present results from a multinomial logistic regression, which - with interaction terms for race and parental wealth - imposes the least constraints on the data, in particular, in contrast to the ordered logistic regression model it allows the coefficients for each independent variable to vary by outcome category. Third, we provide results from a stereotype regression model. In terms of parsimony, this model occupies a middle ground between the ordered and multinomial model: Instead of fixing the coefficients to be equal across outcome categories (as in the ordered logistic model) or allowing them to vary freely (as in the multinomial logistic model), it imposes a linear proportionality constraint on the effects of the independent variables on each outcome category.</p>

<h3>Additional Information on Animation 2</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This animation relies on the weighted cross-tabulation of parental and offspring wealth quintiles, separately for whites and Blacks. To correctly represent the racial distribution across quintiles, we rescale the number of observations by multiplying all observations in these cross-tabulations with the average cross-sectional weight of Blacks and whites in the parental generation. These cross-sectional weights also adjust for the initial PSID oversample of Black households (for a detailed description of the PSID weighting scheme see Berglund et al. 2017a; 2017b). Other research on intergenerational mobility, in particular by economists following Solon (1992), has resisted including the oversample (“SEO sample”) and instead reverted to unweighted analyses of only the population-representative part of the original PSID sample (the “SRC sample”). Animation S.2 therefore reports results restricted to the population-representative SRC sample without additional multiplication of the cross-tabulation by cross-sectional weights, though we caution that the restricted sample size increases concerns about low cell counts (N=1,223).</p>

<h3>Using Different Wealth Quantiles</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The issue of low cell counts can of course be remediated by choosing broader wealth quantile categories. Animation S.3 and S.4 display the intergenerational wealth structure using quartiles or terciles, respectively, though we caution that the broader the categories, the more they hide inequality in the wealth position of Black and white children within those categories. For instance, compared to the middle <i>quintile</i>, within the broader middle <i>tercile</i> of parental wealth, Black children are more heavily concentrated at the bottom of that category and therefore also more likely to fall down to the bottom category in terms of their own wealth position.</p>

Drawing on up to four mentions of race and counting as white only those who do not report any other classification than white across all mentions leads to the reassignment of only 29 cases from the white to non-white category.<a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup></p>
<p><sup id="fn2">2. This illustrates the well-known trade-off between data and assumptions. One of the advantages of full population data, in particular for data visualization purposes, is that they often allow the display of observed relationships without further parametric assumptions, eliminating the need for additional explanation.<a href="#ref2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩</a></sup></p>
<p><sup id="fn3">3. For both whites and Blacks, different tests (e.g., Brant, LR, Wald, and others) fail to reject the null hypothesis that coefficients are equal across outcome categories and the ordered logistic model is also indicated as preferred over the more flexible generalized ordered logistic model based on fit measures that take into account model parsimony (e.g., BIC). However, for Blacks, thanks to the very low numbers of Black children in the top two quintiles, which results in situations of perfect prediction, the statistical tests of the proportional odds assumption for Black children have to be restricted to the bottom four quintiles. Naturally, the near absence of Black children from the top 40% of the parental wealth distribution is not merely a methodological challenge for this particular test, nor just a cause for caution about the heavily model-based identification of mobility patterns among those children, but follows from a a fundamental empirical fact, namely the severely racialized structure of wealth holdings in the United States, which is the focus of Animation 2.<a href="#ref3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">↩</a></sup></p>
<p><sup id="fn4">4. Only the Wald test - but not other statistical tests - fails to reject the proportional odds assumption \((p>0.1)\); though BIC also suggested a clear preference for this model compared to the generalized ordered logistic model.<a href="#ref4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text.">↩</a></sup></p>
