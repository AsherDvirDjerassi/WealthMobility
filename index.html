<h1>Visualizing Intergenerational Wealth Mobility and Racial Inequality</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The black-white gap in household wealth is large and well-documented. Here, we visualize how this racial wealth gap persists across generations. Animating the flow of individuals between the wealth position of parents and individuals’ own wealth attainment, we show that the disadvantage of Black families is not static but extends to intergenerational processes: Black children are far more likely to be downwardly mobile in terms of their household wealth. Furthermore, by displaying intergenerational movement between all parental and offspring wealth quintiles together, we underline how intergenerational fluctuation coexists with the maintenance of a severely racialized wealth structure.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The U.S. wealth structure is extremely unequal and marked by very large racial gaps, with the average Black household holding less than one tenth the wealth of the average white household (Oliver and Shapiro 1995). Whether racial gaps in household net worth – defined as the total sum of assets minus debts – persist partly depends on how closely children reproduce the wealth position of their parents. Here, we visualize and extend our recent finding of racial differences in intergenerational wealth mobility (Pfeffer and Killewald 2018) using a dynamic display of changes in the relative wealth position between parents and their children.</p>
<p>For at least half a century, the social mobility literature has produced evidence on higher rates of downward intergenerational mobility among Blacks compared to whites (Blau and Duncan 1968: 208ff). The finding that Black children are also more likely than white children to fall below their parents’ relative position in the income distribution has recently been replicated based on full population tax and Census data (Chetty et al. 2018) and, with much public impact, visualized by the New York Times (Badget et al. 2018). A similar type of animation is presented in Animation 1 for black-white differences in rates of intergenerational mobility in family wealth using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) assembled in Pfeffer and Killewald (2018).</p>

<h3>Animation 1: <a href="Mobility-Rates/index.html">Mobility Rates</a></h3>
<p></p>
<p>We display the estimated probability of attaining each quintile of the net worth distribution for Black and white children who grow up in the same wealth quintile of the parental wealth distribution. For instance, among those growing up in the middle (twenty percent) of the parental wealth distribution, Black children are much more likely to be downwardly mobile, with 38 percent of them falling to the bottom 20 percent of the wealth distribution compared to 18 percent of white children. Transition probabilities for each parental wealth quintile can be selected interactively and reaffirm the disadvantage of Black children in attaining wealth irrespective of the wealth of their parents.</p>

<h3>Visualization 2: <a href="Wealth-Structure/index.html">Wealth Structure</a></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Animation 1 focuses on racial differences in mobility rates but neglects the fact that Black and white children are also unequally distributed across parental wealth origins. Therefore, Animation 2 rescales the number of dots representing Black and white to match their distribution across parental wealth quintiles. The concentration of Black families towards the bottom of the wealth distribution is immediately visible. And although there is considerable intergenerational fluctuation in wealth positions, the wealth distribution in the offspring generation reveals similarly striking racial wealth gaps. While the representation of Blacks in the middle (20 percent) of the wealth distribution has somewhat increased (from 7 to 14 percent) and so has their overrepresentation in the bottom (20 percent) of the wealth distribution (from 43 to 30 percent), the overall visual impression underlines the considerable stability of racial gaps in family wealth , which we consider to be partly a reflection of continued institutionalized discrimination (see also Oliver and Shapiro 1995). It also illustrates the basic sociological insight that a society can display ample intergenerational fluctuation while maintaining the overall, in this case highly racialized, structure of economic well-being.</p>
