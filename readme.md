# Race and Intergenerational Wealth Mobility: Data Visualization

## Overview
description of the project
We visualize the data collected from a survey of parent and children wealth at the University of Michigan.

## Visualization 1: Transition probability for each quintile
https://github.com/abhsarma/wealth-mobility-vis/tree/master/transition-probability

These visualizations model the data collected by the survey using a Bayesian ordinal logistic regression model. We estimate the probability of a child ending up in each quintile (dependent variable) and use the parent quintile and the race of each survey respondent, as category-specific effects) as predictors. The visualization depicts an equal number of children born into families of different races and contrasts the probability of where they may end up.

## Visualization 2: Social Structure
https://github.com/abhsarma/wealth-mobility-vis/tree/master/social-structure

These visualizations show the data collected by the survey, the quantile in which a child is born into (parent's wealth quantile) and the quantile in which a child ends up.  This data is weighted by the representation of each group in the US population estimates. We show the quintiles and quartile estimates.
