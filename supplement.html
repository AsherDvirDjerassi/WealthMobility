<h3>Data, Sample, Variables</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) as prepared for and described in Pfeffer and Killewald (2018). A replication package containing the data and code used in that paper is available through the PSID Public Data Extract Repository via OpenICPSR at <a href="http://doi.org/10.3886/E101094V1">http://doi.org/10.3886/E101094V1</a> and a full replication package for the animations reported here is available at <a href="http://github.com/fpfeffer/wealthmobility">http://github.com/fpfeffer/wealthmobility</a>.</p>
<p>The net worth measure in the PSID is based on a set of survey questions on the ownership and value of separate assets components, including financial assets (e.g. savings, stocks, etc.), real estate (home value minus mortgages), other real assets (e.g. business and farm wealth, real estate, etc.), and different forms of debt. Parental wealth is measured as average household net worth in survey years 1984 and 1989, which contain the first full asset survey modules. Offspring’s wealth is measured as average household net worth in survey years 2013 and 2015. We restrict the analytic sample to offspring aged 45-64 to reduce life-cycle bias in estimates of intergenerational wealth mobility (as revealed in Pfeffer and Killewald 2018). The average parental age in this sample is 52.0 years (in 1984) and the average offspring age is 53.6 years (in 2013). Net worth quintiles are drawn based on the analytic sample described above using the weighted distribution of wealth for parents and children. The racial classification relies on the first mention of the offspring’s race (but see sensitivity analysis below) and distinguishes Non-Hispanic whites from Non-Hispanic Blacks. The sample size is too low to support separate analysis of other racial or ethnic groups.</p>

<h3>Additional Information on Animation 1</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Unlike the visualization in Badger et al. (2018), which relied on full population administrative data (Chetty et al. 2018), our visualization draws on a much smaller sample from survey data. Thus, rather than simply displaying transition rates based on observed cases, we need to estimate transition probabilities more parsimoniously in a statistical model. Animation 1 displays predicted probabilities from an ordered logistic regression model, i.e.</p>
<p>$$ {Pr(y=q|x)=F(\tau_q-\mathbf{x}\beta) - F(\tau_{q-1}-\mathbf{x}\beta)} $$</p>
<p>which describes the probability of a child attaining the \(q\)’th wealth quintile, \(y\), dependent on a vector \(\bf x\) containing dummy indicators of parental wealth quintile. \(F\) is the logistic cumulative distribution function and the \(\tau_q\) parameters describe the cut-points of the latent measurement model. We estimate the ordered logistic regression separately for white and Black children, which not only accommodates different transition rates, \(\beta\), across race (which could also be attained in a jointly estimated model by interacting the indicators of parental wealth quintiles with indicators of race) but also allows the cut-points of the measurement model to vary by race. The regressions are estimated using PSID’s longitudinal individual weights, which partly adjust for attrition (Berglund et al. 2017a; more on weighting below).</p>
<p>One of the parametric assumptions of the ordered logistic models is the proportional odds assumption, which constrains all βs to be equal across outcome categories q. Testing this assumption using global significance tests (see Long and Freese 2014: 329) allows us to safely reject violations of the proportional odds assumption , lending credibility to the modeling approach chosen for the main animation.</p>
<p>Still, other analysts may be interested in the impact of alternative modeling approaches with either more or less stringent constraints. Animation S.1 displays the results created under alternative approaches: ### First, a slightly more parsimonious approach estimates the ordered logistic regression model jointly for both races (but with interactions between parental wealth quintiles and race), producing a common set of cut-off estimates. The support of the proportional odds assumption is less unequivocal (only Wald test at p>0.1; though BIC also suggested a clear preference for ordered compared to gologit). Second, multinomial logistic regression … . Third, stereotype regression model, which occupies somewhat of a middle ground between ordered and multinomial in terms of its parsimony/assumptions (namely, ).</p>

<h3>Additional Information on Animation 2</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This animation relies on the full, weighted cross-tabulation of parental and offspring wealth quintiles, separately for whites and Blacks. To correctly represent the racial distribution across quintiles we rescale the number of observations by multiplying all observations in these cross-tabulations with the average cross-sectional weight of blacks and whites in the parental generation. These cross-sectional weights also adjust for the initial PSID oversample of Black households (for a detailed description of the PSID weighting scheme see Berglund et al. 2017a; 2017b). Prior research on intergenerational mobility, chiefly by economists (following Solon’s: fn. #) has been critical of the effectiveness of the PSID weights to fully adjust for the oversampling (the so-called “SEO sample”) and reverted to unweighted analyses of only the population-representative part of the original PSID sample (the so-called “SRC sample” original sample
