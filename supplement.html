<h3>Data, Sample, Variables</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) as prepared for and described in Pfeffer and Killewald (2018). A replication package containing the data and code used in that paper is available through the PSID Public Data Extract Repository at https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/psid (#101094) and a full replication package for the animations reported here is available at <a href="http://github.com/fpfeffer/wealthmobility">http://github.com/fpfeffer/wealthmobility</a>.</p>
<p>The net worth measure in the PSID is based on a set of survey questions on the ownership and value of separate assets components, including financial assets (e.g. savings, stocks, etc.), real estate (home value minus mortgages), other real assets (e.g. business and farm wealth, real estate, etc.), and different forms of debt. Parental wealth is measured as average household net worth in survey years 1984 and 1989, which contain the first full asset survey modules. Offspring’s wealth is measured as average household net worth in survey years 2013 and 2015. We restrict the analytic sample to offspring aged 45-64 to reduce life-cycle bias in estimates of intergenerational wealth mobility (as revealed in Pfeffer and Killewald 2018). The average parental age in this sample is 52.0 years (in 1984) and the average offspring age is 53.6 years (in 2013). Net worth quintiles are drawn based on the analytic sample described above using the weighted distribution of wealth for parents and children. The racial classification relies on the first mention of the offspring’s race (but see sensitivity analysis below) and distinguishes Non-Hispanic whites from Non-Hispanic Blacks. The sample size is too low to support separate analysis of other racial or ethnic groups.</p>
